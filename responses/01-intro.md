Hey there, fellow programmer!

Welcome to the Intermediate Node.js course! If you are taking this course, I am assuming you know the basics of Node.js and Express.js. If not, a good place to start is the [intro to node and express](https://lab.github.com/everydeveloper/introduction-to-node-with-express) course, here on GitHub Learning Lab. 

In this tutorial, you will learn how to connect your server to a NoSQL database called MongoDB. You will also learn how to refactor repetitive code, to make it easier to maintain. By the end of this you have a Rest API that can Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) documents in MongoDB.

This is an interactive tutorial. At the end of each section, you will be prompted to do something to continue. If you don't get a response right away, try refreshing your browser.
