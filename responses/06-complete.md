Good Job! üëç You are finished!

But, there is still much more you can do with Node.js Express.js and MongoDB. The [Mongoose.js](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html) library has many more methods you can use, and mongoDB has a [mongo shell](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/mongo/) to manipulate the database with a command line interface. 

If you want to continue with this app, here are some possible next steps for you:

1. Make a front-end to this application, using [AJAX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) to make requests from the API.
2. Add up-vote and down-vote keys to the Topic model, (allowing users to hit the "put" route with their votes).
3. Use [JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io/) to authenticate after a successful log-in.
4. Write a check-token function to authorize different routes (for example, post requests only work on a user's profile if they have a valid token).
